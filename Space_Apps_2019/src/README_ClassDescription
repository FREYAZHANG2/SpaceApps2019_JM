So, here is a breakdown of what I think we need :

allCities : TxtFile to simply copy and paste into, then later to parse through
ChooseCity : loading screen from the menu itself to the city choices, then to different map or to the game itself, should include the creation of own city
City : The city itself : ___Here are parameters___ : Name, Sealevel, Image, Economy
CityGame : Extends the CityGame, should include others like citizen happiness, anything we want ie WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT
Game : The actual game itself lol
Main : Where we test stuff and pretty much everything
Map : The interactive map that they use
Menu : The starting menu
Player : For the player themselves - leaderboard, etc.

Frontend : Game, Menu, Map, ChooseCity 
Backend  : City, CityGame, Player
